# Prerequisites for Linux

The prerequisites: GDAL's Python bindings (python-gdal), Python imaging library (PIL), GDAL binaries (`gdal-bin` 2.2+) and, optionally, `pngnq` utility.

It is quite likely that they are available from your distribution, otherwise it's worth checking with <http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries>.

Then make sure `tilers-tools` directory is included into the `PATH` environment variable.
